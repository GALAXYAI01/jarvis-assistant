Jarvis AI Assistant
This project is a simple voice-activated AI assistant named Jarvis. It's designed to perform basic tasks like opening websites, playing music, and fetching news headlines, all through voice commands. The assistant uses Google's Speech Recognition API to understand commands and the gTTS library to respond with spoken output.

Features
Voice Activation: The assistant listens for the wake word "Jarvis" to begin interacting.

Web Automation: It can open popular websites like Google, Facebook, YouTube, and Gmail.

Music Playback: You can ask it to play specific songs from a predefined list.

News Headlines: It can fetch and speak the top 5 news headlines from India using the NewsAPI.

AI Integration: For commands it doesn't recognize, it uses the OpenAI API to generate a response.

Requirements
To run this project, you'll need the following Python libraries:

SpeechRecognition

pyttsx3

webbrowser

requests

openai

gtts

pygame

You can install them using pip:

Bash

pip install SpeechRecognition pyttsx3 webbrowser requests openai gtts pygame
Additionally, you'll need to set up API keys for the following services:

OpenAI API: For the general AI conversational responses. You must replace {API_KEY} in the main.py file with your actual key.

NewsAPI: For fetching news headlines. A key is already included in the main.py file.

How to Use
Clone the Repository:

Bash

git clone https://github.com/your-username/jarvis-ai-assistant.git
cd jarvis-ai-assistant
Add Your API Key: Open main.py and replace "{API_KEY}" with your OpenAI API key.

Run the Script:

Bash

python main.py
Give Commands: The assistant will announce, "Jarvis is now online." When you speak a command, make sure to include the word "Jarvis" to get its attention.

Jarvis, open Google

Jarvis, open Facebook

Jarvis, open YouTube
